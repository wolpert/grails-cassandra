Cassandra Version: 0.7.0 
Hector Version: 0.7.0-23
Grails: 1.2.2 or higher

(For cassandra version 0.6, please use version 0.5.4 of this plugin)


NOTE:
This is INCOMPATABLE with cassandra 0.6 or earlier. It will also be incompatiable
with earlier versions of this own plugin. You'll have to re-do the api calls
when upgrading to this version of grails-cassandra. 

If you are testing this, it assumes a stock Cassandra 0.7 server is running on
your localhost. Test cases require that you invoked the JMX method 
StorageService.loadSchemaFromYAML after channing the partitioner to
org.apache.cassandra.dht.OrderPreservingPartitioner. This is due to the default
assumptions made by the hector tests.

INSTALLATION:
grails install-plugin cassandra
edit grails-app/conf/spring/resources.groovy:
  beans = {
      cassandraService(codehead.CassandraService){
                  servers="localhost:9160"
                  keyspaceName="Keyspace1"
                  clusterName="Main"
          hideNotFoundExceptions=true
      }
  }

ABOUT

This grails plugins provides a service to enable easy access to Cassandra
from within grails. It is not intended to be a GORM mapping layer.

It specifically wraps the Hector (http://github.com/rantav/hector) API which
makes it easy to connect to Cassandra without dealing with the thrift layer.
Hector also provides for connection pooling, etc.  Hector has gone through
a new API version, so this plugin has to as well.

You can use hector directly, or make use of the helper methods I added to
take advantage of 'groovy-way' to do things. Look at
https://github.com/wolpert/grails-cassandra/blob/master/test/unit/codehead/CassandraServiceTests.groovy
for examples of using both.

Goals:

Primary goals of this project is to have a service that provides easy access
to Cassandra. This includes simplify lookup and setting of Cassandra values,
and optionally hiding 'NotFound' exceptions. (The ruby Cassandra plugin 
returns an empty hash if a searched for value does not exist. Java plugin
throws an exception.)
