Cassandra Version: 0.7.0 
Hector Version: 0.7.0-19_10212010
Grails: 1.2.2 or higher


NOTE:
This is INCOMPATABLE with cassandra 0.6 or earlier. It will also be incompatiable
with earlier versions of this own plugin. You'll have to re-do the api calls
when upgrading to this version of grails-cassandra. 


ABOUT

This grails plugins provides a service to enable easy access to Cassandra
from within grails. It is not intended to be a GORM mapping layer.

It specifically wraps the Hector (http://github.com/rantav/hector) API which
makes it easy to connect to Cassandra without dealing with the thrift layer.
Hector also provides for connection pooling, etc.  Hector has gone through
a new API version, so this plugin has to as well.

Goals:

Primary goals of this project is to have a service that provides easy access
to Cassandra. This includes simplify lookup and setting of Cassandra values,
and optionally hiding 'NotFound' exceptions. (The ruby Cassandra plugin 
returns an empty hash if a searched for value does not exist. Java plugin
throws an exception.)


UNDER DEVELOPMENT:

The development for this plugin has re-started from scratch due to the
extensive (and valuable) changes to Hector. New versions will be 
labeled 0.7 going forward. No new plugin will be provided to the grails
repository until its usable in production. Please review the unit test
CassandraServiceTest to see the direction of the plugin going forward. If you
are testing this yourself, you'll need Cassandra 0.7b2 running, and make sure
you loaded the schema from the YAML file as shown in this post:
http://wiki.apache.org/cassandra/FAQ#no_keyspaces

Finally, note that you will have full access to Hector directly if you do not
want the helper methods provided in the CassandraService layer.
